This template is to be used to create tutorials for the Dojo Toolkit. If you want to use this as a template for something else go ahead. 

Note, the Dojo site currently runs 1.6, so this is for the script that actually runs within the Dojo site. We assume tutorials are written for Dojo 1.7 at this time.
